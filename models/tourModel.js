// ðŸ”´ CREATING INDEXES
// creating an index for a particular query would actually help mongoDb to save its time while querying for the documents. It would then not have to search all the documents for that query but would search according to the index specified
// tourSchema.index({ price: 1 }); // 1 means ascending order; -1 -> descending
// this was for a single query
// we can also make a compund index for a compound query
tourSchema.index({ price: 1, ratingsAverage: -1 });
tourSchema.index({ slug: 1 });
tourSchema.index({ startLocation: '2dsphere' }); // 2dsphere is used for real life location data as on earth

// ðŸ”´ VIRTUAL PROPERTIES
tourSchema.virtual('durationWeeks').get(function () {
  return this.duration / 7;
  // this creates a durationWeeks property which has the no of weeks of the tour based on its "duration" in days
  // ðŸ”´ we cannot query for virtual properties
});

// ðŸ”´ VIRTUAL POPULATE
tourSchema.virtual('reviews', {
  ref: 'Review', // name of the model we want to reference
  foreignField: 'tour', // this is the field in the other model where the reference to the current model is stored
  localField: '_id', // where that id is stored in the current (tour) model (id in this local model is called tour in the other model)
});

// ðŸ”´ DOCUMENT MIDDLEWARES - runs before the save() command and .create() command but not insertMany()
tourSchema.pre('save', function (next) {
  // this points to the currently processed document
  this.slug = slugify(this.name, { lower: true });
  next();

// initially the guides array contained the id of all the users who were the guides to that tour (these ids were given at the time of the tour creation)
// finally after the map fn and awaiting the promises, the guides array would now contain the user documents themselves correponding to the IDs stored

//   console.log('will save document...');
//   next();
// });

// tourSchema.post('save', function (doc, next) {

//   next();
// });

// ðŸ”´ QUERY MIDDLEWARE
// tourSchema.pre('find', function (next) { => this would not work for other find methods like findOne and others
tourSchema.pre(/^find/, function (next) {
  // /^find/ => works for all the methods that start with find
  // this will now point to the current query
  this.find({ secretTour: { $ne: true } });
  // we only want tour where the secretTour is not equal to true
  // this is a query object hence it has access to the find method
  this.start = Date.now();
  next();

  this.populate({

  next();
});

tourSchema.post(/^find/, function (docs, next) {
  console.log(`query took ${Date.now() - this.start} milliseconds`);
  next();
